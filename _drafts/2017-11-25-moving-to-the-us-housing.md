Every city is different but there are some key points shared across the country economic system. I have lived in Portland, OR and New York City and just for comparison, in Portland I only needed the first month rent plus $300 as security deposit to move to my apartment in a top category building (more about how apartments/buildings/houses work in a separate article) whereas in NY I was required to show proof of 45 times the rent in yearly salary (meaning a $2000/mo apartment required earning $90.000 per year,) in addition to a good credit score, past references, and also a whole month for security deposit. Also, sometimes getting the apartment requires a broker, and a fee for them as well (usually 1x the rent)
