Here some tips for the city https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/26512093-post4.html - I can tell you more about the city too. Recommended restaurants in the city:
- Il Ballo Del Mattone (italian food)
- Caba√±a Las Lilas (Puerto Madero, meat)
- Don julio (meat)
- La Cabrera (the one in Palermo, meat)
- El Boliche de Dario (meat Buffet)

Tigre... it's been about 20ys without going! it's beatiful, especially the boat-bondi (bondi is the argentinean word for bus)

Rosario I have been but don't have many places to recommend. Let me ask a friend who is from there.

San Isidro, there are a couple new venues that I'd try:
- Kansas (definitely) https://www.yelp.com/biz/kansas-buenos-aires
- La Dorita (maybe, Spanish review at http://www.themorfi.com/2016/12/05/l...ta-san-isidro/)
- Burger 54, The Embers or CARNE (literally meat is the name of the place) - these are burger places, but if you come from the US, you won't find them amazing.
